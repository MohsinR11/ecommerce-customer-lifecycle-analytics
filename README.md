# Customer Lifecycle & Revenue Analytics - End-to-End Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer retention, purchasing behavior, cohort performance, and lifetime revenue dynamics for an e-commerce business. The goal is to identify when customers churn, how value accumulates over time, and which stages of the lifecycle drive the highest economic impact, enabling better retention, growth, and monetization decisions.

The analysis was executed in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and visualized in Power BI, with a strong focus on real-world, business-driven insights instead of just charts.

## 🧠 Business Problem
The business wanted to understand:
- When do customers churn after acquisition?
- How retention changes across cohorts over time?
- How much revenue is generated across the lifecycle?
- What is the cumulative Lifetime Value (LTV) curve?
- Where should growth, retention, and activation efforts be focused?

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- Cohort & Retention Analytics
- Revenue & LTV Modeling

## 📊 Key Analysis Components

### ✔ Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Transaction standardization
- Duplicate & null handling
- Customer-level aggregation
- Cohort assignment by first purchase month

### ✔ Retention & Survival Analysis
- Cohort retention by lifecycle period
- Survival retention curve to identify real churn window

### ✔ Revenue & LTV Analytics
- Revenue cohorts by acquisition month
- Cumulative LTV growth patterns
- Early-period vs long-tail revenue behavior

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Churn is **front-loaded (Months 1–3)** after acquisition  
- Retention stabilizes at **~18–22%** after Month-3  
- **Most revenue is earned in the first 2–3 months**  
- The LTV curve **flattens sharply after Month-3**  
- Customers who survive past Month-3 deliver **significantly higher LTV**  
- Cohort performance differences indicate **acquisition & onboarding quality gaps**

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

- Focus retention investment in the **first 30–60 days**
- Prioritize **second-purchase activation programs**
- Run **win-back campaigns between Month-1 and Month-2**
- Strengthen onboarding experience for weak cohorts
- Track **cohort-level Retention & LTV as core KPIs**

---

## 📁 Deliverables Included
- Jupyter Notebook (analytics pipeline)
- Power BI Dashboard
- Cohort & LTV analytical datasets
- Executive insights brief + one-page board summary
- Visual exports for quick review

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Channel-wise cohort analysis
- Product-level retention segmentation
- Profitability-based LTV instead of revenue-only
- Controlled experiments for activation uplift
